## Project Overview
The purpose of the analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per unique job title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program as an alternative to immediate retirement.

- 90,398 total employees were identified for retirement.
- The majority of retirees come from the Engineer title, followed by Senior Staff.

### Deliverable 2
- 1,549 retiring employees are eligible for the mentorship program.
  - For full list of employees eligible for the mentorship program, see mentorship_eligibility.csv in https://github.com/mcarson16/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Data.zip
- Mentorship eligibility by title does not strictly correlate to retirement by title.
- No managers are currently eligible for the mentorship program.

## Summary
### Retirement Analysis:
- 90,398 roles will need to be filled if the mentorship program is not utilized.
- Hiring efforts will be most critical for the Engineer and Senior Staff titles.
  - If Senior Staff roles are backfilled by existing Staff employees, recruitment focus should shift to hiring Staff.
